**Project Name: Real-time Ecommerce Data Collection and Processing**

**Description:**

The Real-time Ecommerce Data Collection and Processing project offers a robust and efficient solution for gathering data from various ecommerce websites, processing it in real-time, and storing it in Google Cloud Datastore. The project comprises two parts: a Golang-based data processing pipeline named "Topic2Warehouse" and a Python-based web scraper and publisher.

**Golang Data Processing Pipeline (Topic2Warehouse):**

The Golang pipeline is responsible for real-time data processing and storage. It subscribes to Google Cloud Pub/Sub, receiving data sent from the Python scraper. The received data is then stored securely in Google Cloud Datastore, providing reliable and scalable data storage capabilities. The pipeline leverages Golang's concurrency features, ensuring high throughput and seamless handling of incoming data from multiple sources.

**Python Web Scraper and Publisher:**

The Python application excels in web scraping, collecting valuable ecommerce data from various websites. The scraper uses Python's BeautifulSoup library for HTML parsing and efficiently extracts relevant product details. After scraping, the data is published to Google Cloud Pub/Sub, enabling real-time data transfer to the Golang data processing pipeline.

**Usage:**

1. Set up Google Cloud Pub/Sub and Datastore services.
2. Configure the necessary settings in the Golang "Topic2Warehouse" pipeline and Python "EcommerceDataScraper" application.
3. Run the Golang pipeline using `main.go`, enabling it to subscribe to Google Pub/Sub and store incoming ecommerce data in Datastore.
4. Execute the Python scraper using `main.py`, scraping ecommerce websites, and publishing data to Google Pub/Sub for real-time processing.

**Contributions:**

Contributions to this project are highly welcome! You can enhance the Golang pipeline's data processing capabilities, improve the Python scraper's efficiency, add support for more ecommerce websites, or suggest innovative features to enhance the overall data collection and processing experience.

Join us in building an advanced real-time ecommerce data solution that leverages the power of Golang and Python for seamless data transfer and processing!
